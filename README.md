# Weiler-Atherton-algorithm

Project made for a seminar paper of the subject "Algorithms" on the Faculty of Organization and Informatics, Croatia.

It uses hardcoded clipping polygon and clipped polygon values which consist of: a name, x coordinate, y coordinate and position location value.
The location value specifies whether the points is inside, outside or on the intersection of the polygons as that calculation is done by a different algorithm.
